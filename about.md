I'm currently working as a Technical Lead and Mobile Evangelist at REA Group in Australia, working primarily on the iOS apps and mobile APIs for [realestate.com.au](http://www.realestate.com.au). I've been working on agile software projects for a number of years, and am interested in how to combine agile methods with native mobile product and delivery teams. At the moment, my focus is on sustainable mobile architectures, APIs, maintainable iOS apps and automated app testing.

You can find me as [@stewgleadow on twitter](https://twitter.com/stewgleadow) and as [sgleadow on github](https://github.com/sgleadow). I try to share my thoughts at conferences, like [YOW](http://yowconference.com.au), and local user groups like [Melbourne Cocoaheads](http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/).

My thoughts and content here are my own and do not reflect the opinion of my employer.
