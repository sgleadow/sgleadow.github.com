I'm currently working as a software developer and consultant at [Bilue](http://bilue.com.au), doing a combination of mobile app development, digital strategy and business development.

My passion is developing mobile apps, primarily iOS using Swift and Objective C, as well as emerging platforms like the Apple Watch and Apple TV. I've been working on agile software projects for a number of years, and am interested in how to combine agile methods with native mobile product and delivery teams. My focus is on sustainable mobile architectures, APIs, maintainable iOS apps and automated app testing.
