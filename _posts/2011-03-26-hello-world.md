I've been meaning to start a blog for a while know. Until now, I've kept notes to myself in all sorts of places about problems I've encountered while developing software and solutions I've found. My favourite way of keeping notes to date is in a nice Moleskine notebook with a fountain pen - a bit backwards I know, you wouldn't believe I write software for a living.

Often my notes just disappear into the depths of my filesystem or bookshelf never to be seen again. If I'm really proactive, I might write up an answer on Stack Overflow or reply to a mailing list. The next time I want to share that experience, I have to filter through to find that information again

Hopefully a blog will be an easier way to keep track of this information and later refer to it. Whether it's useful information or not remains to be seen, but it will at least be useful to me. For shorter, random and less useful musings, I'm on twitter at @stewgleadow

The current topics I'm interested in are:

- Objective C and native iOS apps
- testing iOS apps, mainly with GHUnit and Frank
- ReST APIs in Ruby/Rails
- hand-wavy discussion about agile software development and testing in general

User groups I'm involved in or attend occasionally:

- [Melbourne Cocoaheads](http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/)
- [Melbourne Patterns Group](http://melbournepatterns.org/)
- [Agile Alliance](http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Melbourne/)
- [YOW Conference and tech nights](http://www.yowconference.com.au/)
- [Swipe Conference](http://www.swipeconference.com.au)
