    <id>http://sgleadow.github.com/blog/2011/11/16/enabling-accessibility-programatically-on-ios-devices</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote a recent post on <a href="/blog/2011/10/14/enabling-accessibility-for-ios-applications/">enabling accessibility for iOS applications</a>, which ended with a snippet of code for automatically enabling accessibility on the iOS simulator. This is essential if you want to have your tests running on a continuous integration server, since the accessibility inspector is off by default.</p>

<p>I hadn't yet found a solution for enabling accessibility on the device. We need accessibility turned on so that we can access the UIAccessibility values that we use in automated functional tests in one of the <a href="/blog/2011/10/26/which-automated-ios-testing-tool-to-use/">common automated testing tools</a>. My solution up until now has been to turn VoiceOver on, which is a real pain. Since I sometimes use screenshot-based regression tests, VoiceOver breaks the tests since it visually highlights the selected item.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/0xced">Cedric Luthi</a> commented on my previous post that it may be possible to modify his code to also enable accessibility on the device. I wasn't sure how that would work with the app sandbox, and whether it was an application or system preference setting. Last night I gave it a try, and amazingly it worked.</p>

<p>I wrote a simple application based on the master-detail iPhone template in Xcode 4, and wrote a quick <a href="https://github.com/square/KIF">KIF</a> test that checked a label on the master screen, pushed through to the detail screen and checked a label there also. It's a gimmick test, but enough that it will fail if accessibility is <em>not</em> enabled because none of the labels will be available to the test.</p>

<p>After following the standard KIF set up instructions, I write the following test:</p>

<p>```objc
- (void)initializeScenarios;
{</p>

<pre><code>KIFTestScenario *loadScreen = [KIFTestScenario scenarioWithDescription:@"Test app loads up on correct screen"];
[loadScreen addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToWaitForViewWithAccessibilityLabel:@"Master"]];
[self addScenario:loadScreen];


KIFTestScenario *navigateToDetails = [KIFTestScenario scenarioWithDescription:@"Test can navigate"];
[navigateToDetails addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToTapViewWithAccessibilityLabel:@"Detail"]];
[navigateToDetails addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToWaitForViewWithAccessibilityLabel:@"Detail view content goes here"]];
[self addScenario:navigateToDetails];
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>That works fine on the simulator, whether you have explicitly enabled accessibility or not now that the maintainers of KIF have merged in <a href="https://github.com/square/KIF/pull/78">my pull request</a>. That code only runs for the simulator, and does nothing if <code>IPHONE_SIMULATOR_ROOT</code> is not available in the <code>[[NSProcessInfo processInfo] environment]</code>. The KIF test will only run on the device (at least for me) if I turned VoiceOver on, which is a pain and not possible to automate.</p>

<p>I modified the code so that on the device, it does not try to prepend the simulator root when running on the device, and points to <code>@"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AppSupport.framework/AppSupport"</code> directly. Amazingly, the KIF test then worked and all accessibility values were available to the tests. The updated code to enable accessibility programmatically on the device or the simulator looks like this:</p>

<p>```objc
+ (void)_enableAccessibilityInSimulator;
{</p>

<pre><code>NSAutoreleasePool *autoreleasePool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
NSString *appSupportLocation = @"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AppSupport.framework/AppSupport";

NSDictionary *environment = [[NSProcessInfo processInfo] environment];
NSString *simulatorRoot = [environment objectForKey:@"IPHONE_SIMULATOR_ROOT"];
if (simulatorRoot) {
    appSupportLocation = [simulatorRoot stringByAppendingString:appSupportLocation];
}

void *appSupportLibrary = dlopen([appSupportLocation fileSystemRepresentation], RTLD_LAZY);

CFStringRef (*copySharedResourcesPreferencesDomainForDomain)(CFStringRef domain) = dlsym(appSupportLibrary, "CPCopySharedResourcesPreferencesDomainForDomain");

if (copySharedResourcesPreferencesDomainForDomain) {
    CFStringRef accessibilityDomain = copySharedResourcesPreferencesDomainForDomain(CFSTR("com.apple.Accessibility"));

    if (accessibilityDomain) {
        CFPreferencesSetValue(CFSTR("ApplicationAccessibilityEnabled"), kCFBooleanTrue, accessibilityDomain, kCFPreferencesAnyUser, kCFPreferencesAnyHost);
        CFRelease(accessibilityDomain);
    }
}

[autoreleasePool drain];
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>I'm a little bit unsure of the security of this, and whether you actually want your tests messing with your phones system settings on the device - but I usually have separate test devices to my personal phone, and the KIF code is never part of the actual production app that you submit to Apple, so I'm comfortable with it for now. I'm hoping this combined with my <a href="/blog/2011/11/05/installing-ios-apps-on-the-device-from-the-command-line">recent work with fruitstrap</a> could get us all the way to functional tests running on a physical device in CI.</p>

<p>You can find this code in <a href="https://github.com/sgleadow/KIF">my fork of KIF</a>, and I'm hoping after a bit of testing it can be merged into the main KIF repo, so I sent them <a href="https://github.com/square/KIF/pull/93">this pull request</a>.</p>

    <id>http://sgleadow.github.com/blog/2011/11/05/installing-ios-apps-on-the-device-from-the-command-line</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the reasons I run most of my tests in the simulator is that it is easy to install and run applications automatically from the command line with tools like <a href="https://github.com/Fingertips/ios-sim">ios-sim</a>. Being able to run your tests from the command line make s it simple to set up continuous integration. I've used an Applescript to drive iTunes back in Xcode 3 days but it just felt wrong.</p>

<p>The most recent functional testing tool I've been playing with is Apple's own <em>UIAutomation</em>, which runs within the Instruments app. I'll write more about that separately, but let's just say I don't think it's an ideal testing tool, especially if TDD and CI are important to you. Some details are in my <a href="/blog/2011/10/30/adding-unit-tests-to-an-existing-ios-project">comparison of a few functional testing tools</a>. The <code>instruments</code> command line tool does not seem to install the app on the device before running tests, which means you still need to use Xcode to manually install the app. Enter <code>fruitstrap</code>.</p>

<h2>Fruitstrap</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ghughes/fruitstrap">Fruitstrap</a> is a command line tool that uses the private MobileDevice API to install an iOS application on a physical device over USB. It's pretty easy to get set up.</p>

<p><code>
git clone git://github.com/ghughes/fruitstrap.git
cd fruitstrap
make fruitstrap
</code></p>

<p>Fruitstrap comes with a demo applicaiton, which you can compile and install on a device using <code>make install</code>. I actually had a few issues getting the demo app to work, but I did get it working for actual sample applications. You now have the <code>fruitstrap</code> command compiled and ready to go - if you want to access the command from anywhere you probably want to add it to you path, or sym link it to <code>/usr/local/bin</code> or however you like to tinker with your machine.</p>

<h2>Building from the command line</h2>

<p>I made a little sample application to play around with <code>fruitstrap</code> and scripting on my <a href="https://github.com/sgleadow">github</a>, in a project called <a href="https://github.com/sgleadow/fruitstrap-demo">fruitstrap-demo</a>. It's just a simple Single View Application with a couple of labels so you know it's the right app. To get the repository:</p>

<p><code>git clone git://github.com/sgleadow/fruitstrap-demo.git</code></p>

<p>Just to make sure everything is working, open up the project in Xcode and build and run to your device. If that doesn't work, fruitstrap isn't going to help you much. The <code>xcodebuild</code> command allows us to build our iOS apps from the command line fairly easily. The command I used was:</p>

<p><code>
xcodebuild -scheme fruitstrap-demo -sdk iphoneos build
</code></p>

<p>Remember to use the <code>iphoneos</code> so that it builds your app for the device. Note, I originally tried this with the old <em>target</em> settings for <code>xcodebuild</code>, but it turned out I needed to use schemes for reasons explained below. The app will be built to <code>build/Debug-iphoneos/fruitstrap-demo.app</code>.</p>

<h2>Try out fruitstrap</h2>

<p>Now we have an application build on the command line, let's make sure fruitstrap works for our app. Make sure to remove your sample app from the device beforehand so you know it's working. Then use the <code>xcodebuild</code> command above to compile the app so it's ready to go, and make sure you know the full path to fruitstrap, or you've put fruitstrap on your path.</p>

<p><code>
fruitstrap build/Debug-iphoneos/fruitstrap-demo.app
</code></p>

<p>You should see a bunch of output and progress information finishing with the magic <code>[100%] Installed package build/Debug-iphoneos/fruitstrap-demo.app</code>, and in a few moments, the app appears in <em>Springboard</em> on your phone. That's pretty cool - I've been trying to find a solution for installing on the device like that for a long time!</p>

<p>If you have more than one device plugged in (which is usually the case on a mobile continuous integration server), you'll need to also specify the device id.</p>

<h2>Scripting the fruitstrap installation</h2>

<p>My next goal is to write a little shell script that we can integrate into a build phase in Xcode, so that we don't have to hard code the path <code>build/Debug-iphoneos</code> into out shell script. I immediately reached for the Build Phases tab of the fruitstrap-demp target to optionally run the fruitstrap install code. However, these shell scripts seem to get called <em>before</em> the code signing is run, in which case, installing to the device will fail.</p>

<p>I found out from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1409981/how-to-run-a-script-after-xcode-runs-codesign-on-my-iphone-app">this stackoverflow thread</a> that you can run pre and post scripts for a scheme. This allows us to hook up a shell script to run fruitstrap <em>after</em> the code signing.</p>

<p>There is only one scheme in the sample project, so select <em>Edit Scheme...</em>, and select the <em>Build</em> action from the list on the left hand side. There are no actions at the moment, so press the <strong>+</strong> button and add a <em>Run Script Action</em>. Since we need to know where our target has been compiled, make sure that the <em>provide build settings from</em> option is set to <em>fruitstrap-demo</em>, as show in the following screenshot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fruitstrap/fruitstrap-scheme-post-script.png" title="Running a script in the post action for a scheme" ></p>

<p>The actual script code is shown below. It only runs if the <code>FRUITSTRAP_CLI</code> environment variable is set, since most of the time we don't want Xcode to be using this third party tool to install on the device. We only need it to run when running from the command line as part of our continuous integration build. It seems the scheme scripts do not get run in the same working directory as you run xcodebuild, so our script makes sure to change to SRCROOT before running fruitstrap.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>Do nothing unless we are running from the command line</h1>

<p>if [ "$FRUITSTRAP_CLI" = "" ]; then
exit 0
fi</p>

<p>echo "<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>"
echo "Installing app to device using fruitstrap..."
echo "Workspace location: $SRCROOT"
echo "Install location: $TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$FULL_PRODUCT_NAME"
echo "</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>"</p>

<p>cd $SRCROOT
fruitstrap $TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$FULL_PRODUCT_NAME</p>

<p>echo "******************"
```</p>

<p>Check that when you run the xcodebuild example above that it <em>does not</em> run fruitstrap, since we don't want it to in that normal operation. Now, try building the scheme with the environment variable set and check that it does in fact build and install to the device.</p>

<p><code>
FRUITSTRAP_CLI=1 xcodebuild -scheme fruitstrap-demo -sdk iphoneos build
</code></p>

<p>Done. One command to build and install the app on the device.</p>

<h2>More about fruitstrap</h2>

<p>There is more information about fruitstrap on <a href="https://github.com/ghughes/fruitstrap">its github page</a>.</p>

<p>One extra feature fruitstrap has is to be able to launch the application and attach a debugger, by using the <code>-d</code> option. I've had mixed success with this feature, it doesn't always work for me. I'm not sure how much use it is to me anyway if the point of this is running in CI.</p>

<p><code>
fruitstrap -d build/Debug-iphoneos/fruitstrap-demo.app
</code></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Now we can build the application and install it on the device from the command line. From here, the next step is to hook it up to the <code>instruments</code> command line interface. Massive thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/heardrwt">Richie</a> for letting me know about fruitstrap.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to be able to boot the app on the device <em>without</em> being hooked into the debugger. I'm not sure if this is possible, I certainly haven't got it working with fruitstrap yet - and the hairy C code isn't making me want to jump in and try just yet. What we have now is enough to get UIAutomation up and running, since <code>instruments</code> will boot the app when the tests start. However, I'd prefer to use Frank or KIF in which case I need to find a way to boot onto the device.</p>

    <id>http://sgleadow.github.com/blog/2011/10/30/adding-unit-tests-to-an-existing-ios-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently came across a post from the guys at <a href="http://twobitlabs.com">Two Bit Labs</a> on <a href="http://twobitlabs.com/2011/06/adding-ocunit-to-an-existing-ios-project-with-xcode-4/">Adding Unit Tests to an existing iOS project</a> with Xcode 4.</p>

<p>I always include unit tests by default in any project that is more than a demo, but up until recently I have always used <a href="https://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit">GHUnit</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/makdad">Mark Makdad</a> wrote a piece earlier in the year <a href="http://longweekendmobile.com/2011/04/15/unit-testing-in-xcode-4-use-ocunit-and-sentest-instead-of-ghunit">comparing GHUnit and OCUnit</a>. That post combined with <a href="https://github.com/allending/Kiwi">Kiwi</a>'s Rspec-style wrappers around OCUnit has made me consider using Apple's built in unit testing again.</p>

<p>I worked through the post from Two Bit Labs to add a unit test target to an existing project, which all worked fine. Xcode automatically added a new scheme for my new unit test target that only had the <em>Test</em> build action hooked up. This isn't exactly what I wanted. Ideally, I want to run my unit tests without changing the current scheme, and just press <code>Cmd + U</code> or select <code>Product &gt; Test</code> from the menu.</p>

<h2>Adding the test action to an existing scheme</h2>

<p>When I select my target, called <em>Development</em>, that option is greyed out. I have a number of targets set up for this project, so perhaps for simple projects Xcode sorts it out for you... but here is what I had to do in order to get my unit tests hooked up to my main Development target's scheme.</p>

<p>Select your main target's scheme in the little scheme selector in the Xcode toolbar, and choose <em>Edit Scheme...</em> from the drop down menu. When you select the <em>Test</em> build action on the left, you'll notice no tests appear in the list. Tap the <em>+</em> button at the bottom edge of the table, which should show a list of available test bundles (I had a whole lot to choose from because my project has the unfortunate privilege of still including Three20). Choose the unit test bundle you just created you just created and press <em>Add</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/adding-unit-tests/adding-test-action-to-scheme.png" title="Adding tests to the scheme's test action" ></p>

<p>You should see the test bundle appear in the table, as shown in the image above. Tap on the <em>Build</em> action for this scheme, and you will notice that there are now two targets lists: our application and our unit tests. The tests are only linked up to the <em>Test</em> build action by default, which should look similar to the image below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/adding-unit-tests/test-build-action.png" title="Checking the two targets in the build action" ></p>

<h2>Running your unit tests</h2>

<p>Now that your unit tests are hooked up to your test build action, select your main target's scheme. The menu item <code>Product &gt; Test</code> should now be active. Select <em>Test</em>, and Xcode will build your application and run your tests. When creating the test bundle, Apple's default test case includes a failure, so if the tests run, you will see that failure.</p>

<p>Just to double check you've got all your target dependencies set up correctly, try a full clean (hold <em>Option</em> while selecting <code>Product &gt; Clean</code>) and then press <em>Cmd + U</em>. This should trigger a full build and run the unit tests and show your test failure again.</p>

<p>If you see an error like <code>ld: file not found:</code> <code>&lt;path to app&gt;/Debug-iphonesimulator/Development.app/Development</code>, it's likely your test target does not automatically build your main application under test, as explained in the <a href="http://twobitlabs.com/2011/06/adding-ocunit-to-an-existing-ios-project-with-xcode-4/">original article</a>: select your project in the navigator, select your unit test target, open the <em>Build Phases</em> tab and add your app target as a dependency. Ending up with something like the image shown.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/adding-unit-tests/test-target-dependency.png" title="Setting up dependencies for your test target" ></p>

<p>Now... do I use this approach and start convert all my unit tests slowly from GHUnit to OCUnit? I think I might leave existing projects on GHUnit, and just use OCUnit for new tests.</p>

    <link href="http://sgleadow.github.com/blog/2011/10/28/universal-static-libraries-and-frameworks-for-ios/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-28T17:48:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://sgleadow.github.com/blog/2011/10/28/universal-static-libraries-and-frameworks-for-ios</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You only have to look at github to see the explosion of new open source iOS frameworks. Incorporating third party libraries into your app is still a pain. I spent today fighting with static libraries and frameworks for the <a href="https://github.com/domesticcatsoftware/DCIntrospect">DCIntrospect</a> library, and I think I won, so that's got to be work writing about.</p>

<p>The changes I made can be see on <a href="https://github.com/sgleadow/DCIntrospect">my fork of DCIntrospect</a>.</p>

<h2>Static libraries and frameworks</h2>

<p>Until recently, my default use case was to actually drag in the source files from a third party library and compile it into my application. For libraries that I have forked and plan to modify or extend, this would still be my preferred option. Some third party libraries are stable and reliable, and I do not wish to change the source code at all. For these tools, I would prefer to just drag in a static library or framework and get on with my own app.</p>

<p>I've tried my hand at static libraries before, and it definitely wasn't plain sailing. A twitter conversation between two local iOS devs, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/patr">Pat</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/orj">Oliver</a> prompted me to have another go at getting these libraries working. Pat's own tool, <a href="https://github.com/domesticcatsoftware/DCIntrospect">DCIntrospect</a> is a perfect example. It's a great tool for introspecting and testing strange UI layout behaviour in your app, and it's a library that <em>just works</em> (famous last words, I bet you find a bug in it now)... but credit to Pat, I've used it on a few apps, and never touched the source code. DCIntrospect seems like a good case for bundling everything up in a library.</p>

<h2>Static Library</h2>

<p>I created an  Xcode 4 workspace for DCIntrospect, which initially just contained the existing <em>DCIntrospectDemo</em>. The demo included the source code directly, so I removed the references to those files and created a new static library project that included the existing DCIntrospect source files. That basically compiled straight away, but to make it useful, I had to tweak a few build settings.</p>

<p>The target name is DCIntrospectStaticLib, but I wanted the output to be libDCIntrospect.a, which can be done by changing the <strong>Product Name</strong> build setting. I also wanted to group the header files with the compiled binary, so I set the <strong>Public Headers Folder Path</strong> to be <code>$(PRODUCT_NAME)</code> so that it would match whatever I entered for the product name.</p>

<p>To link to this static library, you simply have to drag it into your project. Xcode sorts out adjusting the <strong>Library Search Paths</strong> automatically when you add the library. However, if you want to import headers and make calls to the library, you will need to manually set the <strong>Header Search Paths</strong>. For DCIntrospectDemo, the search path is <code>"$(SRCROOT)/../Products/lib"</code> and then use <code>#import &lt;DCIntrospect/DCIntrospect.h&gt;</code>. That's easy enough to do, but it is one more barrier to entry for people using the library. A static framework could make it a single step.</p>

<h2>Static Framework</h2>

<p>I followed the steps described in <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dineybomfim">Diney Bomfim's</a> updated post on building a <a href="http://db-in.com/blog/2011/07/universal-framework-iphone-ios-2-0/">universal framework for iPhone</a>, and it all went pretty smoothly. He describes the different build settings you have to adjust to get it all to work.</p>

<p>Diney's instructions also include a sample shell script for compiling a universal static library using the <code>lipo</code> tool. I adjusted the script slightly, so that it would build both a universal static library as well as the static framework. I haven't had much success running DCIntrospect on the device, so I'm not sure if that part is working or not.</p>

<p>The joy of using the static framework in this way is that installing DCIntrospect is now a single drag and drop of a framework into your source code. To get it working at this point, you would still need to add <code>#import &lt;DCIntrospect/DCIntrospect.h&gt;</code> into your app delegate and after you have loaded the window, call <code>[[DCIntrospect sharedIntrospector] start]</code>.</p>

<h2>Automatic Loading of DCIntrospect</h2>

<p>My next task is to get DCIntrospect to automatically load if it is linked to your target. I had a play around with this a few months ago with the <a href="https://github.com/moredip/Frank">Frank iOS testing library</a>, with some success but never pursued the final solution, but <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/beingagile">Pete Hodgson</a> obviously got sick of waiting for me and did it himself.</p>

<p>The solution is pretty neat. You basically hook into when a class in the library is being loaded, and set yourself up to listen for the <code>UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification</code> notification, which gets called after the app delegate <code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions</code> gets called. When that happens, we start DCIntrospect. I've wrapped the call to load DCIntrospect in a check that we are running in the simulator, so it will never be called on the app we submit to Apple. Initially I tried to do a check using <code>#ifdef DEBUG</code>, but that wont work with the static precompiled library approach, since those flags are only valid when the library is initially compiled, not at run time.</p>

<p>```objc</p>

<h1>import "DCIntrospect.h"</h1>

<p>@interface DCIntrospectLoader : NSObject
@end</p>

<p>@implementation DCIntrospectLoader</p>

<p>// This is called after application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
// so the statusBarOrientation should be reported correctly
+ (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(NSNotification *)notification
{</p>

<pre><code>NSString *simulatorRoot = [[[NSProcessInfo processInfo] environment] objectForKey:@"IPHONE_SIMULATOR_ROOT"];
if (simulatorRoot)
{
    NSLog(@"Running in simulator, loading DCIntrospect");
    [[DCIntrospect sharedIntrospector] start];
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(void)load
{
  NSLog(@"Injecting DCIntrospect loader");</p>

<p>  [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:[self class]</p>

<pre><code>                                       selector:@selector(applicationDidBecomeActive:) 
                                           name:@"UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification" 
                                         object:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>}</p></li>
</ul>


<p>@end
```</p>

<p>With the auto loading class above now part of DCIntrospect, installation is literally a single drag and drop of the framework. It will automatically load as needed, as long as we are running in the simulator. I usually have a separate target for App Store submission without any test libraries linked into it just in case, since they bloat the binary and probably call some private API magic at some point.</p>

<h2>DCIntrospect Demo Project</h2>

<p>To use either the static library or the framework in the two demo project targets, the only change I had to make was to add the <em>-ObjC</em> setting to <strong>Other Linker Flags</strong>. For the static library, you still need to set a header path but only if you want to make direct calls to DCIntrospect, since it now loads automatically.</p>

<p>Since I had both the DCIntrospect and DCIntrospectDemo projects in the same workspace, XCode 4 had the smarts to find the <em>implicit dependency</em>, so when I edit the library source code, it's automatically rebuilt. However, I set up the project to use the <em>BundleProducts</em> target to create the universal distributable binaries, which did not get picked up as a dependency.</p>

<p>You can create <em>explicit dependencies</em> between targets in different projects by first creating a project dependency. That is, dragging the dependent project into the demo project. Once that is done, when editing the <strong>Target Dependencies</strong> in the demo target's <em>Build Phases</em>, you will be able to explicitly select the dependency. In this case, it is the <em>BundleProducts</em> target.</p>

<p>Unless you plan to edit the source code and recompile the binary often, the chances are you wont need to set up the project dependencies like this.</p>

<h2>Issues with static libraries and frameworks</h2>

<p>DCIntrospect is a fairly simple framework to generate. Larger libraries are likely to come across two issues, neither of which affect DCIntrospect.</p>

<ul>
<li>categories from static libraries don't seem to load properly</li>
<li>resources is static libraries or frameworks need to be linked into the target using them separately</li>
</ul>


<p>For the categories issue, I know if two solutions. First, you can add <em>-all_load</em> to the <strong>Other Linker Flags</strong> section of the target using the static library. We've already added the <em>-ObjC</em> flag in there, so it's not really adding much of a burden. The other option is to use Karl Stenerud's <em>MAKE_CATEGORIES_LOADABLE</em> as <a href="https://github.com/moredip/Frank/blob/master/LoadableCategory.h">used in Frank</a>.</p>

<p>For the resources issue, you can generate a resource bundle along with your static library or framework. When linking the library to your target, you can also drag in the resources bundle as a dependency and it should work. Karl has a neat way of making this even easier in his <a href="https://github.com/kstenerud/iOS-Universal-Framework">iOS Univeral Framework</a> project in github. He creates an <em>embedded framework</em>, which is essentially a single container for both the static framework and the resources bundle. This extra container makes it easy to drag in a single <em>.embeddedframework</em> file into your project and have everything link up correctly.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is probably the first time I have fought with static libraries and frameworks and felt like I came out on top, and DCIntrospect seems like a good case for using it. That said, there are lots of libraries I use where I prefer being able to see the source code, and potentially edit the implementation. For those, git submodules and adding the source directly is still my preferred option. The single drag-and-drop solution here does make using a new library pretty easy though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing around with testing frameworks on iOS for over a year now. There are quite a few out there, all with communities building around them, but I think there are currently a few that stand out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frank</li>
<li>KIF</li>
<li>UIAutomation</li>
</ul>


<p>Other tools that might be worth looking at, but I haven't used and wont comment on are: NativeDriver, LessPainful, iCuke and UISpec.</p>

<p>I recently watched a recording of Pete Hodgson (@beingagile), the primary maintainer of Frank in which he gave a quick summary of the other testing tools, and when it might be appropriate to use them. I made a few notes, and added some of my own thoughts. There is a <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/talks/147-frank-cucumber-tests-for-native-ios-apps">video of the talk</a> Pete gave at <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a>.</p>

<h2>Frank</h2>

<p>Frank has been described as Selenium for native iOS apps. It's a tool written mainly by some fellow Thoughtworkers that uses a combination of <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> and JSON commands that are sent to a server running inside your native application, and leverages <a href="http://code.google.com/p/uispec/">UISpec</a> to run the commands. Frank used to require changes to your production code, but that's got a lot easier with the new static library approach.</p>

<p>I've used Frank quite a bit, and I like it. I have a lot more I could say about it, but I'll leave that for another time. You can find out more about Frank at:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.testingwithfrank.com">Frank's new home page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/moredip/Frank">The github page for Frank</a></li>
<li><a href="/talks.html">A slightly out of date talk I gave on Frank</a></li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em> The good parts of Frank </em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Clean CSS-like selector syntax, allowing for fairly tolerant tests</li>
<li>Active community discussing and extending the library</li>
<li>Driven by Cucumber (if you're a cuke fan)</li>
<li>Includes <em>Symbiote</em>, a live introspection tool</li>
<li>Command line and CI come pretty much for free</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em> The bad parts of Frank </em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Difficult, but not impossible, to run on the device</li>
<li>Separation between tests/native code over HTTP can confuse the cause of failure</li>
<li>Decoupling test/native code into separate processes makes it a bit slower (Pete makes the good point that most of the slowness in your iOS tests are likely to be waiting for animations and transitions, not the HTTP communication)</li>
<li>Very little support for gestures (but hopefully that's coming soon)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em> When using Frank might be appropriate </em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Your team has experience with web application testing tools (Selenium, Cucumber)</li>
<li>You prefer a BDD style of development, with CI support</li>
<li>Your app is not driven by complex gestures</li>
<li>You have a goal of having cross platform tests across Android, iOS and mobile web</li>
</ul>


<h2>KIF</h2>

<p>KIF is an Objective C based framework written at Square. It's a nice solid implementation from what I've seen, with active development going on. Since it's Objective C, you can call out to anything else in your app as well. It's a brand new test framework, so it's not going to immediately integrate with other tools (like JUnit-style XML output and that kind of thing). I haven't KIF a lot yet, so I can't comment too much but I think it shows a lot of promise. You can find out more about KIF at:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/square/KIF">The github repo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/group/kif-framework">KIF Google group</a></li>
<li><a href="http://corner.squareup.com/2011/07/ios-integration-testing.html">The initial blog post on KIF from Square</a></li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em> The good parts of KIF </em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Your tests are in Objective C. Everything in one language, easier for pure iOS devs to pick up</li>
<li>Active community and good support</li>
<li>Pretty reasonable support for gestures</li>
<li>Command line and CI</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em> The bad parts of KIF </em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Your tests are in Objective C. Non-devs will find it hard to read, doesn't make a great executable spec)</li>
<li>Tricky to integrate with back end stubs because it's all running in-process</li>
<li>Not stand alone</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em> When using KIF might be appropriate </em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Primarily a developer driven team</li>
<li>Developers have stronger Objective C skills than Ruby/Cucumber/Javascript</li>
<li>Don't need business folk to read or write test specs</li>
<li>Don't want to deal with the whacky regex from Cucumber</li>
<li>Don't have really complex back end interactions to stub out</li>
<li>Don't have cross platform requirements</li>
</ul>


<h2>UIAutomation</h2>

<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/UIAutomationRef/Introduction/Introduction.html">UIAutomation</a> is Apple's own solution for automated testing. It runs tests written in Javascript through the Instruments application that comes with the developer tools. It sounds like a no-brainer to use Apple's solution for building iOS apps, but I've found it a real pain to deal with in practice. UIAutomation is pretty good for actually driving the UI, but not great for organising and running a test suite, especially from CI. My impression is that Apple QA staff must use UIAutomation for test scripts with profiling instruments attached and actually sit there and watch, it doesn't seem to be purpose built for fully automated testing.</p>

<p>At this point I would like to link to a lot of useful documentation about UIAutomation, but in practice I have found Apple's documentation to be either minimal or non-existent, and very little online discussion past the "boot up an app and tap a button in a single javascript file".</p>

<p><strong><em> The good parts of UIAutomation </em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Apple's own tool. Doing things the way Apple wants is generally a good idea (and as Pete mentions, Apple's not going to go bust or quit iOS any time soon, so the chances are it will be supported)</li>
<li>More closely linked to the device, I primarily run UIAutomation tests on the device, not in the simulator</li>
<li>Good support for gestures (pinch zooming and swipes) and rotation</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em> The bad parts of UIAutomation </em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Not built with CI in mind. The command line integration is pretty bad</li>
<li>Can't integrate with other tools very well</li>
<li>It's Apple's tool, and it's not open source. You can't jump in and fix the bits that are missing</li>
<li>Runs within Instruments, seems to be aimed at regression testing not TDD and aimed at QAs not devs</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em> When using UIAutomation might be appropriate </em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You have a separation between development and QA on your team</li>
<li>You prefer regression test suites over a test-first approach</li>
<li>You don't really care about CI</li>
<li>You prefer manual QA and you just want to speed that up a bit</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So far I've used Frank and UIAutomation on fairly large projects, and I'm very keen to try KIF. Ideally what I would like is the Frank architecture using Cucumber to drive your tests, but using KIF's implementation on the native side which is a lot more solid than UISpec. Frank would give nice clean readable test features, and integration with other tools through cucumber as well as the concise selector syntax. KIF would give gesture support and a much cleaner implementation of those features.</p>
